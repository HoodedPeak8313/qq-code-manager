# QQ Code Manager

## To use this program, you MUST install AutoHotKey first!
Due to the nature of the program, AutoHotKey must be installed before using. Compiling AutoHotKey scripts (.ahk files) to .exe is possible, but unfortunately breaks the way this program works. File editing is integrated into this program, and converting files to executables removes the ability to edit those same files while still maintaining functionality.

***Do not worry!*** AutoHotKey has a very small footprint and can also be installed locally (without needing admin rights to install).

AutoHotKey (abbreviated AHK) is a utility programming language for automating tasks. It may be installed here: **https://www.autohotkey.com/**
